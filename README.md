# Employee-Attrition-EDA-Prediction-

This project focuses on the development of a predictive model for employee attrition and an in-depth exploratory data analysis from Kaggle dataset to gain insights into the underlying factors contributing to attrition within the organization. By combining predictive analytics with data exploration, the project aims to assist HR and management in proactively addressing attrition concerns.

Step 1 : Data Exploration
Read the dataset and calculate the number of rows and columns.
Check for duplicate lines in the data.

Step 2 : Data Analysis and Visualization
Plotted various graphs using seaborn lib, graphs like:
Which department had highest attrition rate?
Gender of the employee?
Travel frequency ?

Step 3 : Data Preprocessing 
Conversion of categorical variable into numerical variable using label enconding to feed data into the model.

Step 4 : Model prediction 
Used random forest classifier for training the dataset to predict whether the employee attrited or not.
